# j2c-plugin-prefix-legacy

Brings back the prefix tooling of `j2c` `v0.11.0-`.

**This is not the PrefixFree- and AutoPrefixer-based plugin**. That one is still in the works (building this one helped sanding off the rough edges of the plugin system).

## Usage:


```SH
$ npm install j2c-plugin-prefix-legacy
```

...possibly using the `--save` flag to put it in the dependencies of your `package.json`

Then

```JS
var j2c = require('j2c')() // create a new instance.
j2c.use(require('j2c-plugin-prefix-legacy'))

// use your fresh `j2c` instance here.
```
